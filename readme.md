These are my dotfiles.

Living in separate repositories before, they now get merged into one.

This includes configurations for:

* awesome
* git
* i3
* tmux
* (n)vim
* et al.

Usage
=====

1. Clone this to ``~/dotfiles``.
2. Symlink configs via ``~/dotfiles/symlink.sh``.
3. Load diff-so-fancy via ``~/dotfiles/bin/diff_so_fancy_install.sh``
