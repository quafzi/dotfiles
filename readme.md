These are my dotfiles.

Living in separate repositories before, they now get merged into one.

This includes configurations for:

* awesome
* git
* i3
* tmux
* (n)vim
* et al.

Installation
============

    git clone https://github.com/quafzi/dotfiles ~/dotfiles && ~/dotfiles/bin/symlink.sh && ~/dotfiles/bin/diff_so_fancy_install.sh
